    <hr>
    <pre style="color:aliceblue;">
        <big>
a <b style="color:aqua;">crule</b> lion lived in the forst. every day , he killed and ate 

a <b style="color:aqua;">lot</b> of animals.the other animals were <b style="color:aqua;">afraid</b> the lion would kill them all.

the animals told the lion,"let's make a deal.if you <b style="color:aqua;">promise</b>"to eat only one

animal each day,then one of us will come to you evrey day.then you don't have to hunt and kill us

the plan sounded well thought-out to the lion,so he <b style="color:aqua;">agree</b>

but he also said ,"if you don't come every day, i promise to kill all of you the next day"

each day after that , one animal went to the lion so that the lion could eat it.then ,all the other animals were <b style="color:aqua;">safe</b> 

<b style="color:aqua;">finally,</b>it was the rabbit's turn to go to the lion.the rabbit went very slowly that day,
so the lion was <b style="color:aqua;">angry</b>

when the rabbite finally <b style="color:aqua;">arrived</b> the lion angrily asked the rabbit,"why are you late"

"i was <b style="color:aqua;">hiding</b> from another lion in the forest.that lion said he was king ,so i was afraid"

the lion told the rabbit ," I am the only king here!take me to that the lion and i will kill him"

the rabbit <b style="color:aqua;">repied,</b>"I will be happy to show you where he lives"

the rabbit led the lion to an old well in the <b style="color:aqua;">middle</b> of the forest . the well was very deep with water at the <b>bottom</b>.the rabbit told the lion .
"look in there.the lion lives at the bottom,"

when the lion looked in the well, he could  see is own face in the water . he thought that was the other lion.

withuot waiting another <b style="color:aqua;">moment</b>,the lion jumped into the well to <b style="color:aqua;">attack</b>

the other lion.he never came out.all of the other animal in the forest were very <b style="color:aqua;">pleased</b> with the rabbit's<b style="color:aqua;">clever trick</b>
